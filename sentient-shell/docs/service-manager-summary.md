# SentientOS Service Manager (sentd) - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a lightweight service manager for SentientOS with the following features:

### Core Features Implemented
1. **Service Lifecycle Management**
   - Start, stop, restart services
   - Process monitoring with PID tracking
   - Automatic restart based on policies (Never, OnFailure, Always, UnlessStopped)
   - Service dependencies

2. **Configuration System**
   - TOML-based service manifests stored in `/etc/sentient/services/*.toml`
   - Service definitions include: command, args, environment, working directory, user
   - Health check configuration with intervals and retries

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Configurable health checks for each service
   - Runs health check commands at specified intervals
   - Tracks consecutive failures for alerting

4. **CLI Integration**
   - Added `service` command to sentient-shell
   - Subcommands: list, status, start, stop, restart, logs
   - Color-coded status display (ðŸŸ¢ running, ðŸ”´ failed, âš« stopped, etc.)

5. **Thread-Safe Architecture**
   - Uses Arc<Mutex<>> for shared state
   - Separate threads for process monitoring and health checks
   - Global service manager instance with lazy initialization

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Rust-only implementation** - No external dependencies on systemd
2. **Local-first** - All configuration stored locally, no network dependencies
3. **AI-ready** - Structured for future AI integration (Phase 2)
4. **Minimal footprint** - Lightweight design suitable for embedded/UEFI environments

## File Structure
```
src/service/
â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs        # Core types and structures
â”œâ”€â”€ manager.rs    # Main service manager implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.rs   # TOML manifest loading/saving
â”œâ”€â”€ process.rs    # Process spawning and monitoring
â”œâ”€â”€ health.rs     # Health check monitoring
â””â”€â”€ api.rs        # CLI command handlers
```

## Next Steps for Phase 2 (AI Model Router)
1. Create AI router service that manages model endpoints
2. Implement model registry with capabilities tracking
3. Add request routing based on model capabilities
4. Integrate with Ollama and other AI services
5. Create unified inference API

## Questions for DeepSeek-v2
1. How can we improve the service dependency resolution algorithm?
2. What's the best approach for implementing graceful shutdown with timeout?
3. Should we add socket activation support for on-demand service startup?
4. How can we better integrate AI services with the service manager?
5. What security considerations should we add for multi-user environments?
