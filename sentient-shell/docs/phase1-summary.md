# Phase 1 Implementation Summary: LLM Router + Embedded Inference

## ✅ Completed Components

### 1. Intent Detection System (`ai_router/intent.rs`)
- Analyzes user prompts to detect 10 different intent types
- Maps intents to model capabilities and performance requirements
- Estimates context length requirements
- Includes comprehensive pattern matching for:
  - Tool/command execution patterns
  - Code generation requests
  - System analysis needs
  - Visual/screenshot analysis
  - Complex reasoning tasks

### 2. Model Configuration (`config/models.toml`)
- Comprehensive model registry with 5 pre-configured models:
  - **phi2_local** - Boot-level fast inference (always available)
  - **llama3:8b** - Balanced general purpose
  - **deepseek-v2** - Powerful for complex tasks
  - **mistral:7b-instruct** - Fast instruction following
  - **llama3.2-vision** - Visual analysis
- Routing rules by intent, performance tier, and context length
- Load balancing configuration
- Offline fallback chain

### 3. Enhanced Router (`ai_router/enhanced_router.rs`)
- Intent-based model selection
- Automatic fallback to offline models
- Context length validation
- Temperature and system prompt adjustment per intent
- Model chain generation with priority sorting
- Graceful degradation on failures

### 4. Configuration System (`ai_router/config.rs`)
- TOML-based model configuration loading
- Configuration validation
- Helper functions for model queries
- Global configuration state management

### 5. CLI Interface (`ai_router/llm_cli.rs`)
- `llm route list` - Show routing rules and mappings
- `llm route test <prompt>` - Test routing decisions
- `llm route info` - Display routing configuration
- `llm model list` - List all configured models
- `llm model info <model>` - Show model details
- `llm model capabilities` - Display capability matrix

## Key Features Implemented

### Intelligent Routing
- Prompt → Intent → Capability → Model selection flow
- Performance-aware selection (realtime/fast/balanced/powerful)
- Context length consideration
- Priority-based model ordering

### Offline Operation
- Local phi-2 model as primary fallback
- Offline chain configuration
- Automatic detection of connectivity issues
- Graceful degradation of capabilities

### Integration Points
- Works with existing Tool Framework for function calling
- Compatible with RAG system for knowledge queries
- Integrates with Boot LLM for recovery scenarios
- Maintains compatibility with existing AI router

## Usage Examples

### Quick Tool Call (Local Model)
```bash
sentient> ask Execute disk cleanup tool
[Intent: ToolCall → Model: phi2_local → Fast execution]
```

### Complex Code Generation (Remote Model)
```bash
sentient> ask Write a distributed cache implementation
[Intent: CodeGeneration → Model: deepseek-v2 → Powerful model]
```

### Offline Fallback
```bash
sentient> ask What is the system status?
[Remote unavailable → Fallback: phi2_local → Degraded but functional]
```

## Testing & Verification

Created test script: `scripts/test-llm-routing.sh`
- Tests routing rule display
- Verifies intent detection
- Validates model selection
- Confirms CLI functionality

## Next Steps for Phase 2

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is set for:
- **RAG-Tool Integration** - Combine knowledge retrieval with tool execution
- **Tool Chaining** - Allow tool outputs to feed next steps
- **Unified Query Interface** - Single command for search + action

The intelligent routing system now ensures:
1. Fast local inference for time-critical operations
2. Powerful remote models for complex tasks
3. Seamless offline fallback
4. Transparent model selection

This creates the "Chain of Logic" where AI can intelligently route requests to the most appropriate model based on intent, capabilities, and system state.
