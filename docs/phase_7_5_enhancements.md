# Phase 7.5 Polish Enhancements

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. ✅ SHA Checksums for Scripts
Generated `scripts/checksums.txt` containing SHA256 hashes for all Python and shell scripts.
- Total: 26 scripts cataloged
- Purpose: Integrity verification and change tracking

### 2. ✅ Structure Snapshots
Created `docs/archive/root_structure_post.txt` showing the cleaned project structure.
- Comparison point for future audits
- Documents the final organized state

### 3. ✅ Validation Script
Added `scripts/validate_structure.py` to verify:
- Scripts directory contains only .py, .sh, .txt files
- Docs archive contains only reports (.md, .json, .txt)
- Config has only .toml, .yaml files
- Writable directories (logs/, traces/, etc.) have proper permissions
- Root contains only essential files

### 4. ✅ Deferred Removals Documentation
Updated cleanup report with "Deferred Removals" section:
- pandas: Retained for Phase 8.X analytics
- scikit-learn: Kept for advanced RL features
- torchvision: Reserved for visual perception modules

### 5. ✅ Git Tag Recommendation
Ready for tagging:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Phase 7.5: Deep project cleanup and structure audit (#phase7.5)

- Moved 26 scripts to /scripts/
- Archived 5 phase reports to /docs/archive/
- Removed obsolete files and caches
- Enhanced .gitignore coverage
- Added validation tools and checksums
- Documented deferred dependency removals"

git tag -a phase-7.5-cleanup -m "Phase 7.5: Project structure cleanup complete"
```

python scripts/validate_structure.py

# Check script integrity
cd scripts && sha256sum -c checksums.txt

# Count files by directory

```
