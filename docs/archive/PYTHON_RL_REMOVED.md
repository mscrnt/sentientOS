# âœ… Python RL Infrastructure Successfully Removed

## What Was Removed
- `rl_agent/` - All Python RL agent implementations
- `rl_data/` - Python training data files  
- `policies/` - Python model checkpoints
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies
- All Python RL scripts and services

## What Remains
- `.venv/` - Python virtual environment (preserved for other uses)
- Rust RL implementation in `crates/`
- Single `docker-compose.yml` with RL support
- Existing `Dockerfile` (no extra files)

## Using the Rust RL System

### Start Services
```bash
# Start SentientOS with RL support
docker-compose up -d

# For RL training mode
SENTIENT_MODE=training docker-compose up

# View logs
docker logs -f sentientos-runtime
```

### RL Commands (when binaries are available)
```bash
# Inside container or with built binaries
sentientctl rl train --agent ppo --env goal-task
sentientctl rl policy list
sentientctl rl reward-graph
```

## Clean Setup
- Single `docker-compose.yml` file
- Single `Dockerfile`
- RL configuration via environment variables
- No confusing extra files

The migration is complete! All Python RL code has been removed and the system is ready for Rust-only RL operation.
