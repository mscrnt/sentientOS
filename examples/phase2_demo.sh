echo "üéØ Key Features Demonstrated:"
echo "- Intelligent intent detection (Pure Query vs Action vs Hybrid)"
echo "- RAG system provides knowledge before tool execution"
echo "- Conditional tool execution based on RAG results"
echo "- User feedback collection for reinforcement learning"
echo "- Trace logging for all executions"
echo "- Performance analysis and model selection insights"
echo

echo "üìù Configuration Files:"
echo "- config/conditions.yaml - Tool execution conditions"
echo "- config/rewards.yaml - Reward policy definitions"
echo "- logs/rl_trace.jsonl - Execution traces with rewards"
echo

echo "üöÄ Next Steps (Phase 3):"
echo "- Train PPO agent on collected traces"
echo "- Optimize model/tool selection based on rewards"
echo "- Implement exploration vs exploitation strategies"
echo "- Auto-tune condition thresholds based on feedback"
